# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes the **Student Performance** dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance).

We explore how academic and social factors — such as **study time**, **parental education**, and **past failures** — impact a student's final math grade (`G3`).

## 🧪 Tools & Techniques
- R, ggplot2, dplyr, corrplot, Metrics
- Data cleaning and feature analysis
- Train/test split and linear regression modeling
- Evaluation using RMSE and R²
- Actual vs. Predicted plotting

## 📁 Files
- `StudentPerformance.Rmd`: Full RMarkdown source
- `PJ1.pdf`: Final report (knit output)
- `student-mat.csv`: Dataset

## 📊 Key Insight
- Students with higher study time and educated parents tend to score better.
- Previous failures significantly reduce final performance.
- Linear regression gives a baseline but can be improved with advanced ML.
